## Lab Assignment 1

Assume that to each person one DHT 11 sensor is assigned.
DHT11 is Temperature and Humidity Sensor and its Operating Voltage is 3.5V to 5.5V,
Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C & Humidity Range: 20% to 90%
Your task is :

1. To generate random values for temperture and humidity which lies in the mentioned
range(As if DHT11 sensor is providing values).
2. Pin setup: Then you wil read these values( Reading random generated data (as if you are
reading from sensor))
3. Controlling Part :- You will set some threshold :a.) Above that threshold you will print weather is hot and value of humidity. 
   b.)Below that threshold you will print weather is cold and value of humidity.
